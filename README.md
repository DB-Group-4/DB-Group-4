# Project Introduction
The project topic is ‘Campus Eats’, it is a food ordering application which will ensure faster and safer mode of food delivery on campuses. From the University’s point of view this application might help them regulate food delivery to staff and students internally by preventing inflow and outflow of the people not related to the university.


Campus eat can also provide users with the ability to order food for on-demand delivery and earn money at their own hours. It can also provide an alternative for tedious part time jobs.


Users can be both the customer and delivery agent at the same time.


Food quality can be closely monitored by the University with on-campus food delivery app which in-turn helps in developing a stronger niner nation. Moreover, campus eats can help both university and the students financially.


Storing data manually can turn out to be a tedious task so instead we can use a database that stores and manages the data efficiently for a smooth functioning. So, the database we are using is campus_eat_fall2020 which consists of the following tables:


  Delivery
 
  Driver
  
  Faculty	
    
  Location
  
  Order	
   
  Person
  
  Restaurant
  
  Staff
  
  Student 
    
  vehicle
    
The purpose of our project is to study and understand the working of the campus eats through the campus_eat_fall2020 dataset and we as a group intend in enhancing the database with a rating system for both restaurants and delivery drivers which will help in improving the performance.
